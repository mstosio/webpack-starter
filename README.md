## Webpack starter pack for small projects

That's my basic starter Webpack starter pack for small project. Includes Babel, Sass-Loader, File-loader, url-loader, CleanWebpackPlugin which prevents from overloaded cache. 

In order to run webpack type:

```
npm start 
```

In order to run webpack dev server: 
```
npm run dev
```

For auto formatiing all code:

```
npm run prettier
```

All generated files are in bundle folder. They are only production mode.
