## Webpack starter pack for small projects

That's my basic Webpack starter pack for small projects. 


Includes:

- Babel
- Sass-Loader
- File-loader
- CleanWebpackPlugin
- OptimizeCssAssetsPlugin
- MiniCssExtractPlugin
- HtmlWebpackPlugin
-BrowserSyncPlugin

In order to run webpack development mode:

```
npm start 
```

In order to build production version: 
```
npm run build
```

For auto formatiing all code:

```
npm run prettier
```

All generated files are in bundle folder. They are only production mode.
